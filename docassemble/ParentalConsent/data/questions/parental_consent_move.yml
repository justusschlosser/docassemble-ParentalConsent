question: |
 Important Information:
subquestion: |
  This interview will help you to tell the city of Duesseldorf, that you consent to have your child moving (parental consent). You musst also consent, if the child moves with you and/or the other parent.
  You can only give/deny your consent if you have (joint-) custody 
  
  Before you provide your consent, be aware, that you can deny your consent if...
  
  1. the move will stop you from visiting your child
  2. the move will endanger your child's development
  
  These points might be particularly true if you move abroad. To be sure, that you can deny your approval, you should contact a lawyer in Germany. If you cannot afford one, the state will pay for it after you apply for it.
  
  The information you give, must match the information on your governmental ID (e.g. Personalausweis, Aufenthaltserlaubnis) If only one parent appears at the adminestrative office ("Einwohnermeldeamt"), you need to bring a governmental ID of the other parent too. The ID is important to prove that the signature is correct.
  
  Most people take about 3 minutes to finish this interview.
